I've been living a sedentary life. I sit a lot. And if I remember correctly, it has been going on for almost a decade. At first, it was because of the nature of the work that I did (I was a translator/editor at that time), but it gradually became a "habit." I was overweight (I still am), had trouble sleeping, and my social life was practically a mess (still somewhat true). It put me in a position where I got tired easily from even doing daily activities.

Then, this year, I decided to put this to an end. I don't really remember the exact reason, though. Maybe it was because I wanted to look better. Maybe I wanted to at least have a better chance of having a long life. Maybe I didn't want to become a burden on the family in the future. Or maybe I just want to feel good about myself. All in all, that's not really important. Some would argue that having a clear reason behind it would help me, but I beg to differ that not having a clear reason also might be better since I won't have some bullshit mindset like "feeling less motivated" to potentially stop me.

So here are a few things that I did:

## Get Up From My Chair
As I said before, I sit a lot because of the nature of my work. That's why I now try to consciously get up from the chair and take a few minutes to walk and stretch. One piece of advice I got is to buy a standing desk and a good ergonomic chair. That's a great idea, but I can't do it right now since I'll be moving from my current place in a few months (hopefully). I will definitely buy them in the near future, though.

## Go To Bed Early
I've been having a sleep disorder for a long time. I know it's not good for my health in the long term, but it's become a habit that even when I try to get into bed early, I still can't fall asleep. Now, I try to consciously get into bed before 11 or 12 PM, maximum. It's still hard to do, but I have seen some progress lately.

## Intermittent Fasting
I jumped into this one in full throttle because I had the mindset that my sedentary life happened because I was overweight. Starting with the 18/6 eating window for two weeks (with a few cheating days) and then going with 20/4 for a month. It was looking really good. I lost a few kg. But after that, my weight was stuck, and even when I kept doing it (the second month coincided with Ramadhan, so I only ate meals once a day when breaking my fast) for another month, my weight was still around the same. Something must be wrong here and I decided to keep looking for the answer. Turns out our body is too smart. After a while, they would adapt to the calorie deficit state and become more efficient at burning calories. So, it became a zero-sum game. Damn.

I came across some articles suggesting a method of intermittent fasting in which you fast for 5 days and then eat normally for 2 days to prevent the body from adapting. However, I found it difficult to stick to this plan because of the 2 "cheating" days. It's hard to limit cheating to just 2 days, at least for me. This method might work for you, though. You should give it a try.

Lately, I no longer practice intermittent fasting, but at least I only eat one or two meals a day now.

## Workout
Finding a weight loss method without including exercise is nearly impossible. I wasn't doing it regularly (at least 5 times a week for a minimum of 30 minutes each time) until late April this year. One thing I've noticed is that exercise won't magically make you lose fat overnight. However, I definitely feel more energized throughout the day after regularly doing it. I feel healthier overall, and that's a feeling I haven't had for since ages.

I've tried to exercise regularly a few times in the past, but one thing that I do differently this time is that I don't over-push myself, at least for the first few days/weeks. I don't know whether it's going to stick from now on though, but I had the feeling it will. I found it to be fun and fulfilling this time.

Start slow, and add more intensity gradually. Just do it at your own pace, for yourself.

## Eat Less and Choose Less Processed Food
I found this one to be the hardest to execute. I don't cook (which is actually the best solution here), and finding a healthy meal around is challenging. Too many processed and unbalanced foods here. Both are way tempting too.

So this time, I am making an effort to choose healthier meals every day. I prioritize vegetables, protein, and fruits while reducing my intake of carbs and flour-based foods. I don't particularly enjoy consuming high-sugar drinks, so this one doesn't bother me that much.

## More Step and Sunlight Everyday
I've been rarely walking. I can chain myself up to my chair the whole day and then just go to bed when I get tired. The walk that I did was just going to the bathroom and taking food, every single day for years. Even when I don't order food online, I will go to the nearest warung by motorcycle. No sunlight exposure too, which means low vitamin D.

But let's face it. Walking took time. So, I try to fix it by combining it with other activities like getting meals. Less ordering food online and more ordering food by walking to the warung. I did it at 10-11 PM every day so I could get sunlight exposure, too. Two birds one stone.

I plan to make time for regular running at least once a week too, but I still frequently end up skipping it. Oops.

Those changes make me feel better overall. I still struggle with it and a lot of other things, but I hope to get better day by day, or at least not get worse than today, haha.
