A few days ago, I had to go back to my hometown because one of my relatives was getting married. As usual, I chose the train for transportation since it's arguably the most comfortable and fastest option. Let's say, Initially I planned to leave on Thursday, but something came up that required me to travel on Friday instead. So, I booked a train ticket for Friday, in the morning, solely because the time suits me better.

Fast forward to Friday—while waiting for the train to arrive, something struck me.

I realized that now I choose tickets based on the time, not the price. It's such a stark contrast to how things were five years ago when I had to meticulously search for the cheapest ticket. I'd spend days, sometimes even weeks, trying to snag the lowest fare. Those trains were often not that comfortable, and the departure times were ridiculously inconvenient—like 3 or 4 AM. Crazy, right?

This small realization brought a flood of memories. I thought about how I finished my undergraduate degree three years late and how, at the time, it felt like such a failure. But now, looking back, it turned out fine. There are so many people out there who struggle just to get access to a proper education, let alone have the luxury of finishing it at their own pace.

Or about how many people fight tooth and nail to make ends meet while I can now afford to think about comfort over cost.

This nostalgic train ride (pun intended, lol) really got me reflecting on how I—and maybe us—sometimes forget this privilege. The privilege to choose. The freedom to choose.

I often take it for granted, forgetting that the life I'm living now is the life the past version of me could only dream of. The place I'm standing now? It's exactly where I once desperately wanted to be.

So, if you have this freedom, be grateful and use it. Embrace it fully. Take the risks while you still can. After all, life isn't just about where you end up—it's also about recognizing and cherishing the moments where you're free to decide the journey.

For those who are still on their journey, remember that every step, no matter how small, brings you closer to the freedom you're working toward. Keep going—you're building the life you'll one day look back on with pride.
