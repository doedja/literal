As an avid DOTA 2 player with more than 5000 hours playing the game, the term "grind" or "grinding" is really familiar to me.

Mistakes were made. I don't like the grinding. Thus, the process feels unrewarding, and even the potential result doesn't entail me. Bad decision, indeed.

A lot of us think about the end result but forget the grind along the way.

If you had the opportunity to choose, to fail, take it. Don't be a chicken, and do what your heart tells you to do. Find something that feels hard to others but easy to you. There is your advantage.

If you can't, try to create it yourself.
