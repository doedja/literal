# The Pause Button I Didn't Know I Had

So here's something weird I noticed about myself recently.

When I do stupid shit (and trust me, I do plenty) there used to be this direct pipeline from feeling to action. Like, zero buffer. Someone annoys me? Instant reaction. Get anxious about something? Spiral time. Feel like procrastinating? Already on YouTube, baby.

But now... something's different.

I still feel all those things. The annoyance, the anxiety, the "I really don't wanna do this" energy. That part hasn't changed. What changed is this weird layer of metacognition (basically, thinking about your own thinking) that kicks in. Instead of just riding the wave of whatever emotion hits me, I kinda... step back?

It's hard to explain, but it's like watching myself from above. Like a bird's eye view of my own dumbass about to do something dumb. And in that moment, there's this conscious "break" where I can actually think: *What am I feeling? Why am I feeling it? And do I actually want to act on this, or is this just my lizard brain being dramatic?*

Most of the time, the answer is: yeah, lizard brain being dramatic.

Real example: I've been catching feelings for someone lately. And it's... a lot. Like, second puberty type of shit. The brain fog, the constant thinking about them, the whole package. If this happened to me five years ago, I would've been a complete disaster. Double texting at midnight. Reading too much into every reply. Making it weird. You know, classic 17-year-old boy energy.

But this time, when I feel that urge to do something stupid, the pause button actually works. I notice the feeling, I understand *why* my brain is being like this (chemicals, loneliness, whatever), and then I can choose how to respond. Like an actual adult. Wild concept, I know.

Does it make the feelings less intense? Nope. Still feels like my brain got hijacked. But at least I'm not acting like a complete idiot about it. Most of the time. (kinda)

And honestly? This has been huge for me. Fewer regrettable texts. Fewer snap decisions. Fewer "why did I say that" moments at 2am when I can't sleep.

Now, I'm not saying I've got this figured out. Sometimes the primal self is faster than the metacognition. The "pause button" kicks in *after* I've already said something stupid or made a mess. Like, thanks brain, really helpful timing there lol.

But when it works? When I catch myself before the chaos? It feels like a superpower, ngl.

I don't know if this is something you can practice or if it just... develops. Maybe it's an age thing. Maybe it's all the therapy money finally paying off. Maybe I just got tired of cleaning up my own messes.

Whatever it is, I'm not complaining.
