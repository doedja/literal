title: "The Privilege of Failing"

I've been thinking about this for a while, but I can at least say that experiencing failure is a privilege, but it's often forgotten and overshadowed by the overwhelming feeling that comes when the setback itself occurs.

Sure, success feels better. That's the end goal (at least for many people). But have you ever thought about this: the more hurdles you overcome, the more shit you endure, the more fulfilling it feels when you finally achieve what you set out to do? The struggle itself adds meaning to the success. It's not just about reaching the finish line. It's about the journey that tested you, pushed you, and made you grow.

I remember Ray Dalio once said, "I learned that failing is an essential step toward success and that the key to success lies in knowing how to both strive for a lot and fail well." That stuck with me. Failing well. So It's not just about failing. It's about how you fail, recover, and turn that failure into a stepping stone. It's about resilience and learning, about embracing the privilege of failure rather than running from it.

Be the one who says, "Okay, what's next?" every single damn time you face an obstacle. Be the one who reframes failure as an opportunity, as a privilege, as something not everyone gets to experience in the same way. Not everyone gets to fall, stand back up, and learn something meaningful from the process.

Be the one who can proudly tell the story of their failures. The missteps, the wrong turns, the almost-but-not-quite moments. Share them. Not just to inspire others, but to let the feeling of growth and perseverance resonate.

Iterate. Be better. Fail well. And try again.
