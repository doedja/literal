This time is about turning everyday life into a game. It's been on my mind lately and I think the idea is quite intriguing.

Games can really hook us. That's a fact, regardless of age and gender. When we start playing, suddenly hours have passed without us noticing. On the other hand, a task like studying, even just for a few minutes, feels like forever.

Now, in some games, especially RPGs, there's always an aspect of "grinding" to level up. But the weird thing is, it's fun the whole time, regardless of how long it takes. We keep playing without getting bored.

So, here's what I'm thinking. In games, we grind because we have some skill issues. That's why we slay monsters to level up some skills or need coins to buy better armor and stuff. I think we should look at our real life the same way. Pretend it's the same.

Imagine if going to the gym felt like leveling up your character. Or if learning a new language was like unlocking a new set of skill trees in a game. It should really make difficult tasks more enjoyable.

What do you think? Have you ever tried something like this?
