title: "A Brief Talk About Money"

This one is tricky because there are a lot of things we can talk about and discuss, but this time, I'm gonna share my thoughts on how I see money and how it's been impacting my life. I'm not gonna talk about the higher form of money, which is wealth, since I want to dumb it down and get the engine running first.

So, here we go.

I see money as a "tool." A means to achieve something. We all could argue that money can't buy happiness, but money itself can buy things that can make us at least closer to happiness. Problems can't always be solved using money, but money can almost always solve or help us better prepare to face a lot of problems. Yes, I believe this applies to, at least, the majority of us.

A "tool" means that money is not the end goal. The end goal should always be something more meaningful—something like our purpose, our "why." For me, personally, having money ready in my arsenal means that it can help me to own my time, my freedom, and let me pursue my "why," which is to enable people around me to have a better quality of life today than yesterday.

Since it's just a "brief" talk as the title suggested, I'm not gonna go technical and delve deeper into money creation or wealth creation, but one thing that I firmly believe is that having a clear mindset about money can change a lot of things.

Now, about the mindset. Always thinking about money doesn't necessarily mean greed. In fact, I think people who achieve so much are always doing that. Have you ever heard about the red car analogy? It's where if you consciously pay attention to red cars, you'll start to feel like there are more red cars now. That doesn't mean there are more red cars. It's just that you're paying more attention to them, so you see more of them. Money is the same. You won't see the opportunity without consciously thinking about it. I think starting from this mindset is a good start.

Those two things, money as a tool and the right mindset, are where I'm standing now. This might change or might not, but one thing for sure is that these principles have been guiding me and helping me navigate my financial journey.

How about yours?
