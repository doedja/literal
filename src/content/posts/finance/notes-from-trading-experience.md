This is by no means a principle, but here are some of the things (not in order) that I've learned from investing and trading cryptocurrency, stocks, and forex (I didn't do forex anymore) since 2020:

1. Setting a goal is a must. I often roundtripped my profit because I didn't have a set of strategies in mind in my early days. Setting where you will take profits and cut losses is an edge.

2. Being greedy when everyone else is afraid and afraid when everyone else is greedy is surprisingly applicable in many scenarios.

3. Don't compromise on security. Be cautious.

4. The market will always find its fair value regardless of how long it takes to do it.

5. Having conviction is a good thing, but I often did not have enough fiat when the opportunities came. Keep some buffers, because sitting and waiting is actually a strategy, too.

6. Market trend is not just a myth. This will emerge as some kind of intuition when you have enough information.

I'll add more over time.
