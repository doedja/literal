title: "FLOW Framework: A Personal Expense Audit"
date: 2025-12-03

At one point, I was diligent about counting daily expenses and organizing everything so I could see where I spent too much and where I could cut.

Then I realized: tracking where money goes doesn't fix how much comes in. So I dropped the habit for months.

Don't get me wrong, counting daily expenses is still a good discipline exercise. But after letting things run wild for a while, I felt the need to do a proper audit. And to help Future Me remember, I'm putting real-ish numbers here.

The problem with tracking expenses is it's easy to get lost in the noise. So I made a simple framework to bucket everything. I call it FLOW.

---

## The FLOW Framework

I group my expenses into four buckets:

1. **Fixed**: subscriptions, memberships
2. **Living**: daily necessities, rent, food, transport, bills
3. **Others**: family support, gifts, charity, anything else
4. **Wealth**: investing, saving, skill acquisition

All numbers below are monthly estimates.

---

## Fixed: $182-202

- Cloud servers: $30
- AI subs (Cursor, Claude, ChatGPT): $80
- Pay-as-you-go AI: $20-40
- Notion: $10
- Cloud storage: $10
- Monthly games membership: $20
- Insurance: $10
- Spotify: $2 (not that $2 is gonna do anything lol)

---

## Living: $280

- Rent: $50
- Daily necessities: $30
- Food: $100
- Bills: $50
- Transport: $50

---

## Others: $100-300

Hypothetically (for obvious reasons), this sits loosely in that range.

---

## Wealth: $300

This one's hard to count because I've switched to a "pay myself first" habit. Income goes here first instead of whatever's leftover.

I don't mentally treat this as spending. It's allocation I'd rather not touch.

---

## Total Outflow

Counting Fixed + Living + Others as money actually leaving:

**$562-782 per month.**

Which is wild because in my head I thought I was doing "modestly" at around $300/month. It literally doubled. lmao.

## Now, What?

Counting doesn't magically fix anything. But it stops you from lying to yourself. Annie Duke calls this "resulting" in *Thinking in Bets*: we judge decisions by outcomes and forget the actual inputs. I thought I was spending $300/month. I wasn't even close. The audit didn't change my spending, but it killed the delusion.

Of course, raw numbers don't mean much without context.

I asked the boys about their monthly expenses too. Answers ranged from $200-800. The spread sounds wide, but it's almost entirely explained by two variables: where they live and how many people they support.

## A Few Things I Learned

**Pareto shows up in spending too.** A small set of things drives most of the burn. Living alone is 45% of my outflow. Fixed is another 31%. Those two explain most of it.

**Location and dependents create huge skew.** Bigger city, more people to support, expenses scale linearly.

**Some people can yolo and be fine**, as long as their safety net is real: insurance, emergency fund, stable-ish income.

**Transportation eats more than you think**, especially owning a car once you count maintenance, insurance, gas, depreciation, and repairs. For me, Grab/Gojek still wins economically and logistically.

## What I Can Actually Slash (Now)

Living, Others, Wealth... I don't want to touch those for now.

But Fixed is the obvious target:

- Keep Claude (main vibe-coding partner)
- Keep ChatGPT (heavy work usage)
- Cut anything redundant
- Most importantly: no pay-as-you-go creep

I'm just trying to stop the silent leaks, that's all.

## Ending

This post is an audit. And like any audit, it's a snapshot, not a solution. The value isn't in the numbers themselves. It's in killing the gap between what I think I spend and what I actually spend.

I'll keep doing these FLOW check-ins once in a while. Especially watching the fixed stuff. These are small enough to ignore, but big enough to compound.

But outflow optimization only gets you so far. Cutting $50 here and there is fine, but the actual game is on the other side of the equation...

...which is the inflow.

Yeah. That's still where the real leverage is.
