title: "Learning by Doing: My Journey Building noure.co"

I've been building noure.co as my personal full-stack playground. That means no grand plans. Just a messy, hands-on dive into real-world development. The main idea is pretty simple: it's a linktree, but for our payments accounts.

I set up the site using **Vite** for a super-fast, static build and **Supabase** to handle the backend without too much fuss. For email, I leaned on **Resend** and hosted everything (including the buckets) on **Cloudflare**.

The design started off with a quick sketch on **Bolt**, and then I let things evolve with the help of **cursor**. And boys, let me tell you, it turned into a non-stop problem-solving session. Every bug and unexpected twist forced me to figure out something new, and it was way more complex than I ever imagined haha.

Sure, it wasn't smooth sailing. Nevertheless, I discovered that real learning happens when you wrestle with the mess. Each challenge pushed me to rethink and iterate my approach.

Now, looking back at the journey so far (nah, it's not that far since I started this just a week ago), I'm stoked about how far an idea can go in this day and age.

So, well... here's to turning crazy ideas into real products, one problem at a time!
